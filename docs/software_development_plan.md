Statement of Purpose and Scope	
Develop a statement of purpose and scope for your application. It must include:
- describe at a high level what the application will do
- identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
- identify the target audience
- explain how a member of the target audience will use it

Features	
Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature


Ensure that your features include the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling


Note: If the features you described do not require you to use all of the above it is likely that your application is not sophisticated enough. Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient to address the assessment criteria.

User Interaction and Experience	
Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.

Your outline must include:
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user

Control Flow Diagram	
Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.
